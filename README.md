## 📌 Introduction

Video content analysis is important for:

- Content summarization
- Automated editing workflows
- Scene segmentation
- Educational content indexing
- Media intelligence systems

Manual video segmentation is slow, repetitive, and difficult to scale. VCIA solves this by providing an automated AI-powered workflow for video scene analysis.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a complete end-to-end platform that can:

- Upload videos through a web interface
- Read metadata automatically
- Detect scene transitions intelligently
- Analyze frames using OpenCV
- Track progress in real time
- Export useful video segments

---

## 🔧 Core Features

### 🎥 Video Upload System

Upload video files directly from the frontend for automatic analysis. Supports real-world video files including MP4 and common formats.

### 🧠 Scene Detection Engine

The backend performs:

- Frame extraction
- Scene transition detection
- Frame difference analysis
- Content segmentation

...using OpenCV-powered processing.

### 📊 Real-Time Progress Tracking

Users can monitor metadata reading, analysis progress, frame processing, and export workflow in real time.

Example:

```text
Analyzing
abc.mp4
43%
Analyzing frames (612/1410)
```
